git init => initilize git
git branch -M main => making default branch as main instead of master
git add => adding all the file which needs to go inside commit 
git commit => creating commit


packapge.json => it is configuration for npm its keep track of what verson of that package install in our system
packapge.json => its lock the verson and keeps the  record it keeps the record of every exact verson 

  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.10.0"
  }

  parcel => it is a bundler like vite and webpack

^ => its called carret => it update minor verson automatically 
~ => its tilde => it update major verson automatically too

when we install any package because we want our app to dependent on that package that package can also have some dependency and that depedency can have their dependecy this is called transitive dependency

node modules => it is a collection of dependency its like database will will have all the dependy


JSX => jsx is html or xml like syntax


When ever state variable changes react rerender the components


important

react uses something known as reconciliation and this recouncilation algorithm also known as react fiber 
suppose we have res container like dom tree its has 7 restaurant cards and now mu ui changes filtering thsese 7 cards to 3 filtered cards
now what react do and why react is fast as soon as cards are filtered from 7  to 3 react create virtual DOM virtual DOM is not an actual DOm 
what is actual DOM its basically a tag 

virtual DOM is representation of actual DOM virtual DOM is an Object whicbh is ReactElement 
its a normal JS object 

DIFF algorithm => Diff algo find the difference between two virtual dom 
find diff between updated virtual DOM and Previous Virtual DOM

Example 
we had a 7 cards in res-container when click on top rated restaurant btn it become three in previous virtual dom has 7 cards and now become 3
it update the state variable and rerender the component
it compare the three card virtual dom with 7 card virtual dom find the diff using Diff Algorithm which is called reconciliation this concept comes in
react 16 then the actual dom is updated 


react can efficiently find out the diff between virtual dom and update the UI 

why react is fast 
because it has virtual DOM 
it has a diff algorith which is very efficient it can do efficient DOM manipulation it can find out the diff and update the UI

react keep UI layer and data layer in SYnc that is the core algorithm of react


in core JS we can not redefine const varaible but how state variable's value get changed even declared with const because it does not change
that variable value when we try to update state var entire component is rendered with new state varibale
