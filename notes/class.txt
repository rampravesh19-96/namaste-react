First Constructor called
second render() called
third componentDidMount()

There are Phases is state and life cycle first is render phase and second is commit phase if two sibling component are here then render phase of 
both sibling batch together and both rendering will get executed then commit phase of both will get exceuted

because when commit phase start react update the DOM and DOM manupulation is most expensive thing so react does not want to DOM manipulation twice
